Purpose:
Provide external, time-stamped proof that evidence existed at a point in time.

Mechanism:
- Batch evidence hashes
- Build deterministic Merkle root
- Anchor root on public network (e.g. RedBelly)
- Store immutable anchor record

Properties:
- Ledger-agnostic
- Deterministic
- Append-only
- Verifiable without trusting Fiducia
